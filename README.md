# QuantitativeImageAnalysisUnitCNB

The Spanish National Centre for Biotechnology (CSIC) is a Severo Ochoa center of excellence. The Unit's responsibility is to provide the image and data analysis tools required to use the many and leading-edge microscopes in the center efficiently. Without these tools, the information extracted from the microscopes would be mostly underutilized due to a primarily qualitative description of the images. Quantitative analysis allows objective comparison of the results under different conditions, and there is an increasing need in science to report quantitative rather than qualitative results. Besides the eventual lack of proper tools to perform the analysis, the knowledge and mastering of the already existing tools are typically outside most researchers' ability, which is why a supporting Unit like this one is required.

The current activity has focused on the development of algorithms and computational tools to perform:
    • Automatic image segmentation
    • Morphological characterization and classification of objects
    • Tracking of objects in videos
    • Trajectory classification
    • Optical characterization of the microscope
    • Correction by software of some of the microscope aberrations
    • Image restoration
